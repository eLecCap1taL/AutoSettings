## What's CSRM CFG Manager?
CSRM CFG Manager is a configuration management program developed using QT6. You can use it to download and configure CSRM online with ease. If the correct JSON is added, CSRM CFG Manager should be applicable to any CFG project.üëç

## What's <a href="https://github.com/eLecCap1taL/CSRM">CSRM</a>?
CSRM is a large-scale CS2 CFG project aimed at integrating and supporting all CS2 CFG functionalities while offering powerful customization options. It also features a custom radial radio, allowing players to visually access CSRM's functions in-game. CSRM is primarily designed for competitive mode rules, meaning it operates under `sv_cheats 0`. However, it also includes some features that can be used in personal practice modes.

In the future, with the CSRM CFG Manager, you'll be able to download and update your CSRM CFG online, with support for cross-version settings preservation. Additionally, features like custom automated props and quick modifications to resources will be supported.

The ultimate goal of CSRM is to become the ONLY CFG you'll ever need for CS2. üëç

In most cases, using CSRM will not result in a VAC ban. It is simply a CFG project. üëç

## Some fun facts
> When you bhopping, the autostop can automatically turn off (Optional)

> You can use fakecheat, fastshift, auto-bhop, auto-attack and autostop at the same time. They can work together, and that will make you like a real cheater! XD

> You can use `SetPreAimOn` in AutoLineUp, then when you throwed a nade, you will be automatically set to another angle. This is useful when using bug flashes, but they are dead now :(
